# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage using leaflet and an earthquake API to display all earthquakes in the past 7 days. The map includes three tile layers using the leaflet style of street, satellite street, and dark. The map also includes three overlays which allow the user to toggle the earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plate lines.
